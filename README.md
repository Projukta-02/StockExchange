# Stock Price Prediction

### Dataset Description:
The dataset primarily revolves around the stock prices of a company, with the LTP column denoting the "Last Traded Price" on a daily basis. Other columns might include various indicators and financial metrics associated with the stock market, though the specifics of these columns were not detailed in our discussion.

### Questions Answered:

Trend Analysis: Visualized the stock price trend over time to understand its movement and trajectory.
Volatility Analysis: Estimated the stock's daily returns and identified periods of high volatility.
Predictive Modeling: Used historical stock prices and associated metrics to predict future prices.
Predicted the upward or downward movement of stock prices using classifiers like Random Forest.
Feature Importance: Determined which features were most influential in predicting stock price movement using Random Forest's feature importance capability.
Clustering of Stock Movements: Implemented K-means clustering to group stock movements into clusters, helping identify typical vs. volatile days.

### Results:

Stock Price Visualization: The plotted stock prices over time provided an insight into the company's stock performance.

Predictive Modeling: The Random Forest model was employed for both regression (predicting exact stock prices) and classification (predicting stock direction). The accuracy metric for classification stood at XX% (based on provided inputs).
For the regression model, evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used to assess the model's performance.
Feature Importance: Certain features emerged as more influential in predicting stock movement than others, providing insights into which factors most impact stock price trajectories.

K-means Clustering: The clustering highlighted potential groupings in stock price movement based on daily returns, which could be useful for risk assessment and trading strategy development.
